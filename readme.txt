Quick Affiliate Store helps you get the best from your Amazon Affiliate Program links. Use a simple shortcode in your pages to display a gorgeous product grid and create a store-like experience!

== Description ==

With Quick Affiliate Store you can create a nice looking store-like experience on your website using just a shortcode. 
You will be able to monetize your website through the Amazon Affiliate Program links while providing a good-looking experience to your users.

Take a look at the screenshot for a preview!

To get started you just need to install the plugin, adjust a few simple settings filling in your Amazon Affiliate Program details and start using the shortcode on your posts and pages.

The product grid will appear using the [qas_product_grid] shortcode:

`[qas_product_grid keywords="YOUR KEYWORDS"]`

That's all it takes!

= Shortcode options =

The [qas_product_grid] shortcode provides some more options to further customize the look of the product grid:

- *max_products*: only display this maximum amount of products (defaults to no limit)
- *show_price*: hide/show the product prices (defaults to "yes")
- *button_text*: the text to put in the purchase buttons (defaults to "Buy")

Example:

`[qas_product_grid keywords="jackets" show_price="yes" max_products="10" button_text="Buy"]`

Quick Affiliate Store is also compatible with both the Classic Editor and new Gutenberg Block Editor.
